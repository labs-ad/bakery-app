# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Development Environment Setup
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish a complete development environment for the Dadalicious bakery app including local Next.js setup, PostgreSQL database, Google Cloud Platform configuration, CI/CD pipeline, and basic authentication to enable efficient development and deployment workflows.

## User Stories

**As a new developer joining the team**, I want to set up the complete development environment in under 30 minutes so that I can start contributing to the codebase immediately without extensive configuration overhead.

**As a developer working on features**, I want a reliable local development workflow with hot reloading, database seeding, and testing capabilities so that I can iterate quickly and confidently on new functionality.

**As a team lead**, I want an automated CI/CD pipeline that handles testing, building, and deployment so that code changes can be safely promoted from development to production with minimal manual intervention.

## Spec Scope

1. **Next.js 14 Application Setup** - Complete TypeScript application scaffold with development server and build configuration
2. **Local Database Environment** - PostgreSQL setup with Prisma ORM integration and development data seeding
3. **Google Cloud Platform Configuration** - Project setup with Cloud SQL, Storage, and deployment configurations
4. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation** - GitHub Actions workflow for testing, building, and deploying to GCP
5. **Authentication Foundation** - NextAuth.js setup with basic user management and multiple provider support

## Out of Scope

- Production data migration
- Advanced security configurations beyond basic setup
- Third-party service integrations (Stripe, email services)
- Frontend component library setup (handled separately)

## Expected Deliverable

1. New developers can clone the repository and have a fully functional local development environment running within 30 minutes
2. Code changes automatically trigger CI/CD pipeline with successful deployment to staging environment
3. Basic user authentication flow works end-to-end from local development through production deployment
